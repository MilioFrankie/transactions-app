## Project Setup
My focus was on the Front-End Homework Assignment.

I used the elixir backend for this project. Must go into `/elixir` and do: 
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Then go into the `/webapp` and do: 
  * Install dependencies with `yarn`
  * start dev server `yarn start`
  * `yarn test` to run tests

## Instructions

See the [frontend instructions](frontend.md) for frontend focused instructions.
